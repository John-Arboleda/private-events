# Project: Private Events

This is a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs House‚Äù). A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
